# SEAL with linear transformation

## Decription
Add fast linear transformation algorithms to Microsoft SEAL

## Achieved
`paddingEncode` in ckks encoder which adds padding to a vector and encode it.

## Future plan
 - `repeatEncode` for BSGS method with tall matrices
 - all computing methods
 - more friendly API
